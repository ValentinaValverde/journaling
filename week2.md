# Week 2

Today is Saturday, September 9th, and I am back at NEXT. Yesterday I completed the last day of week 2 at Carolina Code School, and I have to say, I love it.

I don't really know what else to say other than that I enjoy coding. I like that working on these things takes my mind off of things happening at home, and I like the joy I get when I do something right or something turns out the way I want it to. 

Now, I shall follow the prompt and answer the generic questions :D

Before this class, I was just another normal teenager using the Internet for entertainment. I asked Google my stupid questions and was always on Pinterest and Instagram. Simple, mind-numbing distractions. Now, I rely more heavily on our blessed Google, but spend less time on social media.

I think that after the class, I will still be on the Internet all the time; sometimes I think my parents are right and it is my damn phone causing all my problems.

I still feel the same way about the Internet as when I started, and I don't feel as though that will change after the course.

As for how I feel about coding- I really do enjoy it. I like learning things because it makes me feel smart, and even though this course makes me feel dumb half the time, I still feel smart (...sometimes). But I know that it will get so much harder before it gets easier, and I like to think that I'm prepared for that. I'm willing to put in the work that it takes to get better at coding.

I think if I had to rank how I feel about navigating code, I'd say a solid 6. I don't feel absolutely terrible like I did at the beginning, but I most definitely don't feel like the best either. I know that we're only at the tip of the iceberg, and I'm intimidated at how much more there is to learn. 

On the topic of imposter syndrome- I don't know. I don't feel like an imposter. I know that each of us have a unique style of learning and we each learn at our own pace. But there is still a part of me that feels like I have to work a little harder. Maybe it's to make my family proud, maybe it's for my own sense of self-worth. It's why I stay at the school a few hours after class is technically over. It's my silly teenage insecurities, and I have no idea if that tied to imposter syndrome.

Sometimes I'm reminded of what I'm sacrificing to be here. I spent the first half of the day today hanging out with my baby sister. I miss sitting down during lunch with my friends or my family and having a good time and a good meal. Here, I still have a good meal. By the time I get home, I only have time to eat by myself, sometimes shower, and go to bed.

But other times, I'm reminded of what my parents have sacrificed for me to be here. And I ignore my feelings and push onward. I suspect that it will get worse over the next few weeks, but deep down somewhere I know that it's going to be worth it.

I feel as though I have been too vulnerable. This was fun. Yipee!
